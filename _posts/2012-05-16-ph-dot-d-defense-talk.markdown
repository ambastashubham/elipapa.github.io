I've seen many share slides on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net) before, but I was impressed with the ease and the clean interface of [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/). To test it out, I have uploaded my ph.d defense talk. Not only the permalink is quite intuitive, but one can also embed the presentation in a page quite easily:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="4fb3bab625741e001f029e0a" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

This may be a good way to store presentations: browse to the website and click fullscreen, no more thumb drives.
